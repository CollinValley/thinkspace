Hi, my name is Collin Valley and I am a systems programmer. I currently work at Cisco Meraki, where I work on a team
that does the operating system bring-up of our new wireless products. The job is mostly complicated by maintaining our
own kernel for our firmware, and making sure that changes to our new products work, and don't cause performance regressions
with our old ones.

I originally got my education in Computer Engineering at the University of Illiois, Urbana-Champaign.  If you are considering attending
that program I highly recommend it! I started my programming education with the NPN transistor, and forming logic gates, and worked up
from there. As such, I did not get a lot of formal education about creating and maintaining websites, hence the reason I created this site
in the first place. I wanted to build something, kind of from the ground up, and deploy it to the web.  Not much of a novel concept for some,
but I learned a great deal in the process.

My interests have lately been with Rust. There isn't much I can say here that hasn't already been said; if you are a systems programmer
who is tired of C++, and would like a higher, but still performant, language give it a go! I've also been eye-balling Go lately, though
I have not dipped my toes in yet.
